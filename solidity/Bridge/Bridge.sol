/* Bridge Smart Contract 
* @noot
* this contract is a generic bridge contract that will emit a Deposit() 
* event upon receiving ether. this Deposit() event will then be picked up by the bridge,
* which acts as a client. the bridge will then submit a transaction to withdraw ether
* on the other chain. when this withdraw is completed, a Withdraw() event will be emitted.
* 
* this contract will be deployed on both sides of the bridge.
